<h2>Letter of recommendation</h2>
<a class="image fit"><img src="../images/leo.jpeg" alt="Léo" /></a>

<p>
Léo (born in 2002, resident in Nantes, France) sailed with me on my sailing yacht <a href="ovni.html">FSM</a> from Agadir, Morocco, to Dakar, Senégal, from 25/9 to 21/10/2024, during my <a href="https://lizmap.faunalia.eu/index.php/view/map/?repository=faunalia&project=sail"> transatlantic crossing</a>.</br>
He never listened to my advice, neither technical nor for security, nor even for simple cohabitation (even hygiene and cleanliness).
In spite of having declared to have followed sailing courses in the well known Glénan sailing school, and of his declared engineering background, he did not understand even the most basic concepts of sailing, even after 4 weeks of intensive sailing. He damaged several equipment on board, without offering neither compensation nor reparation.
Finally he refused to contribute to boat expenses, as agreed upon.</br>
On my boat I had over the years more than 70 crew, and I've been sailing with more than 200 people. The 4 weeks with Léo have been the most unpleasant of my whole career at sea, and Léo is the only crew I've ever been obliged to disembark.</br>
I can therefore recommend not to deal with Léo, not only as a crew, but for any activity, either recreational or professional.</p>
