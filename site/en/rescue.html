<h2>Scary stuff</h2>

<p>I was impressed by the story <a href="https://floatmagazin.de/leute/nightmare-on-wilson-street-sea-rescue/">[1]</a>  <a href="https://floatmagazin.de/leute/rescue-from-the-wilson-street-sea-rescue/">[2]</a> of two sailors being caught by the medicane Ianos 50 NM off Malta, and rescued by a cargo, a very detailed, clear, and well written article.
I think they should be praised for keeping their cold blood as much as possible in a difficult situation, and few people could have done better (I would probably have not). No criticism here, therefore. This mine is just an attempt to make the best of this story, learning why things went wrong and how to prevent this from happening again.
I'd appreciate your constructive criticism on this a analysis, so please do not hesitate <a href="mailto:cavallini@faunalia.it?subject=Sailing">writing me</a>.</p>
<p>Out of the many problems they encountered, I think two are especially relevant and causing more directly the trouble: (i) lack of fuel; (ii) lack of weather forecast.</p>
<hr />

<div id="fuel">
<h2>Lack of fuel</h2>

<p>This was due essentially to the fact they were not allowed to enter Greek waters and ports (OK, larger tanks, more jerricans, earlier would have helped, but this is not the point). As far as I know (I may be wrong, if someone knows for sure please write me) authorities allow bunkering when needed - at least Italians do so, even in these difficult Covid times. As far as I understand from the article, they did not asked, probably scared by earlier reaction by Limeniko Soma.</p>
</div>
<hr />

<div id="forecast">
<h2>Lack of weather forecast</h2>

<p>This is more complicated, and has a more direct impact on the outcome. It is unclear (apparently not) whether they attempted to get VHF gale warnings from either Greece or Italy, whether there was coverage in the area (apparently <a href="http://weather.mailasail.com/Franks-Weather/Italy-Weather-Forecast-Sea-Areas">there should be</a>), and how long before the warning were issued (unfortunately, <a href="http://clima.meteoam.it/InserisciRichiestaDaParametro.php">these data are not freely available</a>). The failure of their cell phone was important, but probably would not have allowed The lows were reported on September 14th, and developed into a severe depression by 15th (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Ianos">Cyclone_Ianos</a>). The rescue happened during the day of 16th, so everything was quite fast indeed, confirming the importance in the Med of getting the forecast every two days as a minimum.</p>
</div>
<hr />

<div id="raft">
<h2>Life raft</h2>

<p>The failure of the life raft was also quite scary, possibly what worries me most. The manufacturer (not disclosed in the article, this would be very interesting to know) apparently could not explain why, which is frankly difficult to accept. I assume it was correctly serviced, I believe the manufacturer would have mentioned this otherwise. In this situation, we sailor are left with a huge question mark about the reliability of this crucial safety equipment.</p>
</div>
<hr />

<div id="boat">
<h2>Leaving the boat</h2>

<p>The boat was found in relatively good conditions some times later, which speaks well of the marine qualities of production boats (a 15 years old, possibly chartered, 40 ft Jeanneau). The general recommendation of never leaving your boat until she actually sinks holds therefore true in this case, but obviously this would have been crazy knowing the life raft failed.</p>
