Hi, thanks for the compliment. Your boat is an old design, from 1986 even if it was produced since 2002, almost a record, designed by a good NA, Philippe Briand and from the time were that French type of boats had a lot of ballast (that it is needed). Your boat has an almost 50% B/D while a more modern OVNI 495 (2007) has only 35.6%. That makes your boat seaworthy but also slow in light winds. No, I have never sailed your boat or for that matter a "deriveur" that can be very interesting sailboats in what regards polivalance but are not the type of sailboats that personally I like more. On boats with swing keels I prefer the ones that have all ballast on the keel and regarding those and aluminium boats, the one I would not mind to have (LOL) is the Allures 45.9 that has a version with that type of keel. To understand the difference, for the same stability the version with all the lead on the keel weights less 2000kg, for the same sail area. You can imagine the difference in performance.
