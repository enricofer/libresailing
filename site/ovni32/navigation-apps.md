# State of the map: a review of navigation maps for Android

# Orca

Free version quite limited, even in the length of routes, only online maps etc.
Reliable maps available for only a handful of countries.

# BoatPilot

Free app and offline maps. Only a few countries are available currently, they say they'll add more over time. Maps seem equal to Navionics.
Significant battery draw.

# C-Map

Free app (requires registration). Free online maps (forever?), offline should be purchased (cheaper than Navionics if for larger areas).

# Navionics

Free app, offline maps, including updates, under annual licence (usually 20-60 â‚¬ per region).
Pirate copies can be found that allow download and update offline maps, but apparently stopped downloading in late 2021.

# OpenSeaMap

A free and open source project, based on and inspired from the hugely succesful OpenStreetMap. It adds ligths, buoysetc., but unfortunately depths are generally unavailable.
A number of app use them, e.g. SeaWi, OSMAnd with its navigation plugin, etc.

# OpenCPN

Free and open source app (available also for Linux and Windows, OSX?). Maps not included, older C-Map from about 2000 can be found on the net, under dubious terms. Official maps available for some countries at a cost from o-charts, possibly other sources.
